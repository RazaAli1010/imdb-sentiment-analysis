# IMDb Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDb movie reviews using machine learning.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

I use the [IMDb Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) which contains 50,000 movie reviews labeled as **positive** or **negative**.

## ðŸ”§ Steps

1. **Load and Explore the Dataset**  
   - Check dataset structure, class balance, and clean missing data.

2. **Preprocess the Data**  
   - Clean text, remove noise, and transform text into numerical representations.

3. **Build Models**  
   - Train machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes).
     

4. **Evaluate Performance**  
   - Compare models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Visualize and Report**  
   - Visualize class distribution, confusion matrices, and provide a final summary.

## ðŸ’» Deliverables

- Jupyter Notebook with code, markdown explanations, and results.
- Performance comparison of multiple models.
- Final thoughts and recommendations.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies (requirements.txt or environment.yml).
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Colab notebook.
